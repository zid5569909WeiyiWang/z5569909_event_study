def portfolio_main(tickers, start, end, cha_name, ret_freq_use, q):
    """
    Constructs equal-weighted portfolios based on the specified characteristic and quantile threshold.
    We focus on total volatility investment strategy in this project 2.
    We name the characteristic as 'vol'

    This function performs several steps to construct portfolios:
    1. Call `aj_ret_dict` function from etl script to generate a dictionary containing daily and
       monthly returns.
    2. Call `cha_main` function from cha script to generate a DataFrame containing stocks' monthly return
       and characteristic, i.e., total volatility, info.
    3. Call `pf_main` function from pf script to construct a DataFrame with
       equal-weighted quantile and long-short portfolio return series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tickers : list
        A list including all tickers (can include lowercase and/or uppercase characters) in the investment universe

    start  :  str
        The inclusive start date for the date range of the price table imported from data folder
        For example: if you enter '2010-09-02', function in etl script will include price
        data of stocks from this date onwards.
        And make sure the provided start date is a valid calendar date.

    end  :  str
        The inclusive end date for the date range, which determines the final date
        included in the price table imported from data folder
        For example: if you enter '2010-12-20', function in etl script will encompass data
        up to and including December 20, 2010.
        And make sure the provided start date is a valid calendar date.

    cha_name : str
        The name of the characteristic. Here, it should be 'vol'

    ret_freq_use  :  list
        It identifies that which frequency returns you will use to construct the `cha_name`
        in zid_project2_characteristics.py.
        Set it as ['Daily',] when calculating stock total volatility here.

    q : int
        The number of quantiles to divide the stocks into based on their characteristic values.


    Returns
    -------
    dict_ret : dict
        A dictionary with two items, each containing a dataframe of daily and monthly returns
        for all stocks listed in the 'tickers' list.
        This dictionary is the output of `aj_ret_dict` in etl script.
        See the docstring there for a description of it.

    df_cha : df
        A DataFrame with a Monthly frequency PeriodIndex, containing rows for each year-month
        that include the stocks' monthly returns for that period and the characteristics,
        i.e., total volatility, from the previous year-month.
        This df is the output of `cha_main` function in cha script.
        See the docstring there for a description of it.

    df_portfolios : df
        A DataFrame containing the constructed equal-weighted quantile and long-short portfolios.
        This df is the output of `pf_cal` function in pf script.
        See the docstring there for a description of it.

#
# - Do not create any other functions inside the scripts you need to submit unless
#   we ask you to do so.
#
# - For this part of the project, only the answers provided below will be
#   marked. You are free to create any function you want (IN A SEPARATE
#   MODULE outside the scripts you need to submit).
#
# - All your answers should be strings. If they represent a number, include 4
#   decimal places unless otherwise specified in the question description
#
# - Here is an example of how to answer the questions below. Consider the
#   following question:
#
#   Q0: Which ticker included in config.TICMAP starts with the letter "C"?
#   Q0_answer = '?'
#
#   You should replace the '?' with the correct answer:
#   Q0_answer = 'CSCO'
#
#
#     To answer the questions below, you need to run portfolio_main function in this script
#     with the following parameter values:

# Q1: Which stock in your sample has the lowest average daily return for the
#     year 2008 (ignoring missing values)? Your answer should include the
